profle shot of me leaning slighly on the rail of large steel bridge in the rain. the city glowsin the distance . reflections in puddles ripple from raindrops . i wear a waterproof shell and scarf , looking contemplatively into the distance . desaturated colors , with only a few warm highlights from distant headlights.
